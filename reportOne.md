  _Created by: Zichen Wang_


## Description
  This report includes a brief instruction on how to set up your cse15l account, install necessary software
  and try out some commands.


## Step 1: Visual Studio Code and GIT
  **Visual Studio Code**
  
  For this course, you will need Visual Studio Code as a necessary platform of coding.
  Go to [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for downloading the installation pack.
  After you click the download button the page should be like this.
  
  Now, go to your download folder, and find the installation pack (should be an executable application).
  Follow the guidelines to get the application installed.
  
  After installation complete, you may need to restart your PC or laptop.
  > Notes: you may consider installing your VSC to other disks other than C: since system 
  > disk should have as much free space as possible.

  **Git**
  
  In this course, we are running some code blocks on remote servers, which requires the use of Git.
  Go to [Link](https://gitforwindows.org/) for downloads.
  
  Similar to the process when you install the visual studio code, you can simply follow the guidelines to complete the installation process.
  > Notes: For Git, it is highly recommended to install it to the default path, since you do not need to configure it in VSC if you do so.

  > If you install the Git to default path, you may skip the following step: "Configuring Git and VSC."
